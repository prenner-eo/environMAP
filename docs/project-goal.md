# Project Goal


Our project investigates the relationships between environmental exposures and mental health outcomes using cohort data. We focus on reproducible geospatial workflows and transparent reporting to support cross-site comparability and cumulative science.


**Objectives**


1. Define harmonized environmental exposure metrics across regions.
2. Model associations with mental health outcomes while controlling for key covariates.
3. Share open, reusable methods and documentation to enable replication.


**Outcomes**


- Openly documented code fragments and processing steps.
- A public-facing summary of findings (non-technical) and links to scientific publications (technical).
