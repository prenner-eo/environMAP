# Regions & Cohort Sites


We collaborate with multiple cohort sites. A high-level overview will be maintained here, including data collection periods, sample sizes, and key site characteristics. A map and table will be added once finalized.


> *Note*: Exact site metadata will be updated as the paper is finalized.
